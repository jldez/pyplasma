To do list.

***General***
initialize rho in 1D or 2D should work without the boundary ghost cells

***Boundaries***
PMLs along y and z axes.

***Lasers***
Laser source on any boundary. 
Choose polarization axis.
Phase parameter should actually be a phase. Find other name for toggling on/off the oscillations.

***Materials***
Self-trapping
Incubation
Validate medium mask float values along y and z working properly
Move out ionization stuff
Fluence thresold finder
Volume inhomogeneities
material presets in init file

***Observers***
Watcher should show actual material mask
Loop over multiple watchers
Watch back dumped data
Returner fail safe for memory



***Far Future***
Alternatives to Drude model
Dynamic collision rates
